## [Unreleased]

## [v0.5.0]

### Fixed
- **Plan → Implement infinite loop** — `sdp.developer` previously combined `plan-task` and `implement` modes behind a self-referencing handoff, which in `auto` mode caused agents to repeatedly re-trigger implementation instead of proceeding to review. Split into two agents:
  - `sdp.planner` (Gate 4) — plans only, never writes code, never self-invokes.
  - `sdp.developer` (Gate 5) — implements only, never plans, hands off exactly once to `sdp.reviewer`.
- `coding-standards.instructions.md` and `sdlc-process.instructions.md` both declared `applyTo: "**/*"` and duplicated the same orchestration/routing content, which was concatenated twice into the generated root `AGENTS.md`. `coding-standards.instructions.md` now covers coding standards only; `sdlc-process.instructions.md` is the single source of truth for process/routing.
- `sdp.reviewer`, `sdp.security`, and `sdp.qa` used inconsistent severity scales (Critical/Major/Minor/Suggestion vs. Critical/High/Medium/Low), making hardening findings hard to aggregate. Unified to a single **Critical/High/Medium/Low** scale across all three.

### Added
- **Configurable security review policy** — epics now declare `security_review: per-story | epic-level | waived` (with a mandatory reason for the latter two). Reviewer/security/QA respect this without complaining when explicitly deferred or waived, and still block if the policy is missing on stories touching auth, secrets, external input, or data boundaries.
- **Plan Scope Budget** — `PLAN.md` now requires a mandatory budget (max 8 files, ~300 changed lines, complexity tier S/M/L, stated exploration scope) to keep implementation time and token usage predictable. Oversized stories must be split and returned to Gate 2 instead of being planned/executed as-is.
- **Missing gate artifact templates** — added `.apm/templates/PRD.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `EPIC.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `PLAN.md`, `HISTORY.md`, each with a `status: draft | approved | rejected` header so gate approval is a checked field rather than inferred from conversation.
- **Hardening loop breaker** — after 2 failed hardening cycles on the same story, the responsible agent stops auto-retrying and escalates to the user (descope, split, or accept documented risk) instead of looping through Gate 5/6 a third time.
- **Resumable session state** — `ACTIVE.md` extended with `current_gate`, `current_story`, and `status` fields so interrupted sessions resume at the correct point.
- **Story sizing / effort feedback** — `sdp.analyst` applies INVEST sizing (~1 day/1 PR per story); `sdp.architect` rates story complexity (S/M/L) in `DESIGN.md` so oversized stories are caught before planning rather than during it.

### Changed
- `README.md` — updated Quick Start walkthrough, 6-gate diagram, feedback loop table, agents/prompts/templates reference tables, and source/installed file-tree diagrams to reflect the `sdp.planner`/`sdp.developer` split, security review policy, and new templates.
- `AGENTS.md` (generated) — regenerated via `apm compile`; no longer contains duplicated routing/orchestration content.
- Bumped version to `0.5.0`; expanded default `targets` in `apm.yml` to include `claude`, `cursor`, `codex`, and `gemini` alongside `copilot`.

### Added
- `apm.json` — Agent Package Manager manifest defining package metadata, components (agents, skills, prompts, templates), and installers
- `package.json` — npm ecosystem compatibility manifest with scoped package name `@wojcikmm/spec-development-protocol`
- APM installation method documented in `README.md` (Method 2)
- APM Package Structure section in `README.md` explaining manifest structure and distribution model
- `sdp.developer.agent.md` — new `Approve plan and proceed to implementation` handoff entry in frontmatter, providing a one-click option to approve the plan produced by `/plan-task` and immediately move to implement mode (alternative to manually invoking `/implement`)
- `install.ps1` — PowerShell installer for Windows users (PowerShell 5.1+/7+), feature-parity with `install.sh`: same environment variables (`SDP_BRANCH`, `SDP_FORCE`, `SDP_TECH_MODE`, `SDP_TARGET`), TECH.md modes, commit-SHA versioning for branch installs, and `spec/` directory creation
- `README.md` — Windows Quick Install section with PowerShell one-liner (`iwr … | iex`), execution-policy note, and PowerShell examples for all install scenarios

### Changed
- `install.sh` — versioning now appends the short commit SHA when installing from a branch (e.g., `main@a1b2c3d`), making branch-based installs comparable and traceable; tag-based installs continue to use the tag name unchanged
- `src/skills/` restructured to comply with the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io): each skill is now a subfolder (`<skill-name>/`) containing a `SKILL.md` file instead of a flat `sdp.skill.<name>.md` file
  - `sdp.skill.write-tests.md` → `write-tests/SKILL.md`
  - `sdp.skill.create-api-endpoint.md` → `create-api-endpoint/SKILL.md`
  - `sdp.skill.create-ui-component.md` → `create-ui-component/SKILL.md`
  - `sdp.skill.database-migration.md` → `database-migration/SKILL.md`
  - `sdp.skill.error-handling.md` → `error-handling/SKILL.md`
- All skill frontmatter updated to include both `name` and `description` fields (required by the Agent Skills standard)
- `README.md` — Skills section updated: table now lists skill folders instead of flat files; Customization and Project Structure sections updated to reflect the new layout

### Added
- `src/skills/` directory with 5 web-focused skill files:
  - `write-tests/SKILL.md` — unit and integration test guidance (AAA, TDD, behavior-based testing)
  - `create-api-endpoint/SKILL.md` — REST API endpoint design, validation, auth, error handling
  - `create-ui-component/SKILL.md` — frontend component structure, accessibility, state, testing
  - `database-migration/SKILL.md` — safe schema migrations, rollback patterns, zero-downtime techniques
  - `error-handling/SKILL.md` — error classification, structured logging, safe API responses, retries
- `src/templates/template.skill.md` — starter template for writing custom skills
- `src/prompts/qa-validate.prompt.md` — missing prompt for triggering the QA agent (Gate 6)
- `.github/sdp-version` file written by installer to track installed SDP version
- Feedback loops table in `sdlc-process.instructions.md` documenting return paths for each failure type
- Handoff sequence documentation in `sdp.reviewer.agent.md` and `sdp.qa.agent.md`

### Fixed
- `src/prompts/create-prd.prompt.md` was incorrectly set to `agent: sdp.analyst`; corrected to `agent: sdp.prd`
- `sdp.reviewer.agent.md` had duplicate content between `Responsibilities` and `Review Focus` sections; duplicate removed
- `sdp.developer.agent.md` had three concurrent Gate 6 handoffs (reviewer + security + QA simultaneously); now hands off only to `sdp.reviewer` to enforce the sequential Gate 6 flow

### Changed
- `src/templates/TECH.md` — replaced Azure-specific sections (Azure DevOps, Bicep, Azure Key Vault) with platform-agnostic equivalents covering any CI/CD system, hosting provider, and secrets manager; kept web-application focus
- All agent `Mandatory Context` sections updated: removed "Azure environment constraints" wording; now references "project-specific constraints" from `TECH.md`
- `src/agents/sdp.security.agent.md` — replaced Azure security baselines with OWASP Web Top 10 and generic web security checks (CSP, CORS, cookies, secrets manager agnostic)
- `src/agents/sdp.architect.agent.md` — added explicit output path `docs/architecture/DESIGN-<slug>.md`
- All prompts enriched with prerequisite checklists, descriptions of what will happen, and next-gate guidance
- `README.md` — added Skills section, end-to-end Quick Start example table, feedback loops description, `sdp-version` mention; corrected "Agents hand off automatically" to "Agents suggest handoffs"
