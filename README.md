**SDP** is an open-source, AI-agentic framework that enforces spec-driven software delivery using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode. It structures your development workflow into a repeatable 6-gate SDLC process — from product requirements through hardening — so no code is written without a specification, and no specification is incomplete.

SDP installs into the `.github/` folder of any project repository and works with both greenfield projects and existing codebases.

## Why SDP?

AI coding assistants are powerful but undisciplined by default — they generate code immediately, skip design, and ignore traceability. SDP solves this by layering a structured delivery protocol on top of GitHub Copilot:

- **Specification before code** — every feature starts with a PRD and is refined into stories before any implementation begins.
- **Traceable decisions** — architecture choices, plans, and history are recorded in versioned Markdown files alongside your code.
- **Role-separated agents** — dedicated agents for product, analysis, architecture, development, review, security, and QA enforce separation of concerns.
- **Human approval at every gate** — agents propose; you approve. No gate advances automatically.
- **Safe for existing codebases** — install into any repository without modifying source files.

---

## Prerequisites

Before installing SDP, ensure the following are in place:

| Requirement                                                                                    | Version             | Notes                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |

## Installation

### Method 1: Direct Installation (Recommended)

Run the installer from the root directory of the target project repository.

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WojcikMM/spec-development-protocol/main/install.sh | bash
```

#### Windows (PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell 7+)

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WojcikMM/spec-development-protocol/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

> **Execution policy note:** If you encounter a script execution policy error on Windows, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` and retry.

Both installers copy the `.github/` framework files into the target repository **without overwriting any existing files**. A `.github/sdp-version` marker file records the installed version.

---

### Method 2: APM (Agent Package Manager)

If your environment supports APM:

```bash
# Add SDP marketplace (one-time per machine)
apm marketplace add WojcikMM/spec-development-protocol

# Install SDP from that marketplace
apm install spec-development-protocol@spec-development-protocol
```

#### Install from the GitHub repository

apm install WojcikMM/spec-development-protocol

The `apm.yml` manifest defines all agents, skills, prompts, and templates included in SDP.

---

### Method 3: Manual Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Create `.github/` in the target project root if it does not already exist.
3. Copy the entire contents of `.apm/` into `.github/`.
4. Do not overwrite existing files in `.github/` unless you intend to upgrade.

---

### Installer Options

The direct installers accept configuration via environment variables:

| Variable        | Default           | Description                                                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SDP_BRANCH`    | `main`            | Install from a specific branch or release tag                                  |
| `SDP_FORCE`     | `false`           | Set to `true` to overwrite existing SDP files during an upgrade                |
| `SDP_TECH_MODE` | `init`            | Controls `.github/TECH.md`: `init` (create if missing), `overwrite`, or `skip` |
| `SDP_TARGET`    | current directory | Target repository root path                                                    |

**bash examples:**

```bash
# Install a specific release version
SDP_BRANCH=v1.0.0 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WojcikMM/spec-development-protocol/main/install.sh | bash

# Upgrade an existing installation (overwrite SDP-managed files)
SDP_FORCE=true curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WojcikMM/spec-development-protocol/main/install.sh | bash

# Upgrade SDP files but preserve the existing TECH.md
SDP_FORCE=true SDP_TECH_MODE=skip curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WojcikMM/spec-development-protocol/main/install.sh | bash

# Reset TECH.md from the template (useful when re-initializing a project)
SDP_TECH_MODE=overwrite curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WojcikMM/spec-development-protocol/main/install.sh | bash
```

**PowerShell examples:**

```powershell
# Install a specific release version
$env:SDP_BRANCH='v1.0.0'; iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WojcikMM/spec-development-protocol/main/install.ps1 | iex

# Upgrade an existing installation (overwrite SDP-managed files)
$env:SDP_FORCE='true'; iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WojcikMM/spec-development-protocol/main/install.ps1 | iex

# Upgrade SDP files but preserve the existing TECH.md
$env:SDP_FORCE='true'; $env:SDP_TECH_MODE='skip'; iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WojcikMM/spec-development-protocol/main/install.ps1 | iex

# Reset TECH.md from the template (useful when re-initializing a project)
$env:SDP_TECH_MODE='overwrite'; iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WojcikMM/spec-development-protocol/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

---

## Setup

### 1. Fill in `TECH.md`

After installation, open `.github/TECH.md`. This file is the single source of truth that all SDP agents read before taking any action. Populate it with your project's:

- Frontend and backend technology stack
- CI/CD pipeline and deployment environment
- Coding standards and conventions
- Security baseline and identity model

`TECH.md` is your file — SDP updates will never overwrite it unless you explicitly set `SDP_TECH_MODE=overwrite`.

> **Existing project?** Run the `discover-tech` prompt to invoke the `sdp.discover` agent, which scans your codebase and generates a draft `TECH.md` for your review.

### 2. Add `AGENTS.md` Context Maps

`AGENTS.md` files scope agent context to relevant portions of the repository, reducing noise and improving response quality. Place them as follows:

- **Repository root** — one global `AGENTS.md` for project-wide rules and boundaries.
- **Backend modules** — one `AGENTS.md` per library or service folder (e.g., next to each `.csproj` file).
- **Frontend packages** — one `AGENTS.md` per app or package root (e.g., `apps/web`, `packages/ui`).

All SDP agents are pre-configured to read the root `AGENTS.md` and the nearest module-level `AGENTS.md` before performing deeper file discovery.

A starter template is available at `.github/templates/AGENTS.md` after installation.

### 3. Enable Agent Mode in VS Code

SDP agents require **GitHub Copilot Agent Mode** in VS Code. Verify that the [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) extension is installed and that agent mode is available in the Copilot Chat panel.

---

## Quick Start: End-to-End Example

The following example walks through adding a "User Registration" feature to an existing web application using the full SDP gate sequence.

| Step | Action                                                                            | Prompt                 | Output                                                     |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Describe the feature in plain language                                            | `create-prd`           | `spec/user-registration/PRD.md`, `spec/ACTIVE.md`          |
| 2    | Review and approve `PRD.md` (set `status: approved`), then break it into stories  | `refine-backlog`       | `spec/user-registration/BACKLOG.md`, `EPIC-1-core-flow.md` |
| 3    | Design the technical solution                                                     | `design-system`        | `spec/user-registration/DESIGN.md`                         |
| 4    | Select story `US-1` and create a scope-budgeted implementation plan (no code yet) | `plan-task` + "US-1"   | `spec/user-registration/PLAN.md`                           |
| 5    | Approve the plan (set `status: approved`), then run `implement` explicitly        | `implement` + "US-1"   | Source code, tests, `HISTORY.md` updated                   |
| 6a   | Review the implementation                                                         | `run-review`           | Review findings report                                     |
| 6b   | Perform a security audit (unless the epic declares `epic-level`/`waived`)         | `audit-security`       | Security sign-off or findings                              |
| 6c   | Validate acceptance criteria                                                      | `qa-validate` + "US-1" | Pass / Fail verdict                                        |
| 7    | Repeat Steps 4–6 for the next story                                               | `plan-task` + "US-2"   | —                                                          |

Each user story passes through Gates 4–6 independently. You retain full control at every approval checkpoint — no agent advances the process without your confirmation. **`plan-task` and `implement` are separate agents (`sdp.planner` and `sdp.developer`) with no self-referencing handoff**, so they never loop into each other automatically — moving from a plan to code always requires you to approve the plan and run `/implement` explicitly.

---

## How It Works

### The 6-Gate SDLC Process

SDP enforces a sequential gate model. Work cannot advance to the next gate until the current gate's artifact has `status: approved`. This prevents scope creep, undocumented decisions, and code written without a specification.

```md
Gate 1: Discovery → spec/<slug>/PRD.md + spec/ACTIVE.md
Gate 2: Refinement → spec/<slug>/BACKLOG.md + EPIC-\*.md (declares security_review policy)
Gate 3: Architecture → spec/<slug>/DESIGN.md (rates story complexity S/M/L)
Gate 4: Planning → spec/<slug>/PLAN.md (one story at a time, with a mandatory Scope Budget)
Gate 5: Implementation → Source code + tests → spec/<slug>/HISTORY.md updated
Gate 6: Hardening → Code review → Security audit (or deferred/waived) → QA validation
```

Every gate artifact carries a `status: draft | approved | rejected` header. Agents only treat an artifact as valid input once it is `approved` — approval is a checked field, not inferred from conversation.

**Feedback loops** — gate failures route work back to the correct earlier gate, not the beginning:

| Failure                                            | Returns to                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code review failure (Critical/High)                | Gate 5 — fix and re-run Gate 6 from the start                                                                       |
| Security finding (Critical or High severity)       | Gate 5                                                                                                              |
| QA validation failure                              | Gate 5                                                                                                              |
| Security finding requiring architectural change    | Gate 3                                                                                                              |
| Same story fails the same hardening step **twice** | Escalated to you — the agent stops auto-retrying and asks you to decide (descope, split, or accept documented risk) |

All findings across review, security, and QA use one severity scale: **Critical, High, Medium, Low**.

### Controlling Security Audit Scope

Not every story needs its own security audit. Each epic in `BACKLOG.md`/`EPIC-*.md` declares a `security_review` policy:

- **`per-story` (default)** — audited every time, before QA.
- **`epic-level`** — deferred until the whole epic is implemented, then audited once as a batch.
- **`waived`** — explicitly skipped, with a required, documented reason (e.g., internal tooling with no external input or auth changes).

Agents will not complain about a missing security step if the policy is explicitly `epic-level` or `waived` — but they will stop and ask you to set the policy if a story touches auth, secrets, external input, or data boundaries with no policy declared.

### Feature Folder Structure

All specification artifacts for a feature are co-located in `spec/<feature-slug>/` at the project root. Agents create and update these files automatically using the templates in `.github/templates/` — you do not need to manage file placement or formatting manually.

```md
spec/
ACTIVE.md <- identifies the currently active feature, gate, story, and status
user-registration/
PRD.md <- Gate 1: product requirements document
BACKLOG.md <- Gate 2: epic index + security_review policy
EPIC-1-core-registration.md <- Gate 2: stories, acceptance criteria, sizing
DESIGN.md <- Gate 3: technical design + story complexity ratings
PLAN.md <- Gate 4: current story implementation plan + Scope Budget
HISTORY.md <- Gate 5/6: running log of completed work and hardening outcomes
checkout-flow/
PRD.md
...
```

**`spec/ACTIVE.md`** declares which feature is currently in progress:

```yaml
slug: user-registration
title: User Registration
```

When a new PRD is created, `sdp.prd` derives the slug from the feature title, initializes the feature folder, and writes `ACTIVE.md`. All subsequent agents read this file automatically — you do not need to specify the active feature in each chat session.

To switch to a different feature, update `spec/ACTIVE.md` directly, or run `create-prd` for the new feature.

### Working on a Legacy Project

SDP is fully compatible with existing codebases:

1. Populate `TECH.md` with the current stack, or run `discover-tech` to generate a draft automatically.
2. Run `create-prd` to describe the change, bug fix, or improvement area.
3. Follow the gate sequence from there. Agents respect the existing architecture and constraints defined in `TECH.md`.

---

## Reference

### Agents

Each SDP agent has a single, well-defined responsibility. Agents are implemented as `.agent.md` files and invoked via the Copilot Chat panel in Agent Mode.

| Agent           | File                            | Responsibility                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sdp.prd`       | `agents/sdp.prd.agent.md`       | Authors `PRD.md` from a business intent description                                               |
| `sdp.discover`  | `agents/sdp.discover.agent.md`  | Scans an existing codebase and drafts `TECH.md`                                                   |
| `sdp.analyst`   | `agents/sdp.analyst.agent.md`   | Refines a PRD into epics, features, and user stories; declares each epic's security review policy |
| `sdp.architect` | `agents/sdp.architect.agent.md` | Produces a right-sized technical design document and rates story complexity                       |
| `sdp.planner`   | `agents/sdp.planner.agent.md`   | Creates a scope-budgeted implementation plan for one story — never writes code                    |
| `sdp.developer` | `agents/sdp.developer.agent.md` | Implements one approved plan at a time — never plans, never self-loops                            |
| `sdp.reviewer`  | `agents/sdp.reviewer.agent.md`  | Performs code and design review; routes security per epic policy                                  |
| `sdp.security`  | `agents/sdp.security.agent.md`  | Conducts a security audit against OWASP web baselines (per-story, epic-level, or waived)          |
| `sdp.qa`        | `agents/sdp.qa.agent.md`        | Validates story acceptance criteria                                                               |

Agents propose handoffs to the next role — for example, the reviewer agent offers to invoke the security agent after completing its review. Each handoff requires explicit confirmation before proceeding. `sdp.planner` and `sdp.developer` never hand off to themselves, so planning cannot loop into repeated re-implementation.

---

### Prompts

Prompts are the entry points that activate agents in the correct mode. Each prompt file documents its prerequisites and describes the expected outcome before the operation begins. **Prefer prompts over invoking an agent by name** — each gate has exactly one entry-point prompt.

| Prompt           | Activates       | Gate                                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `discover-tech`  | `sdp.discover`  | Legacy onboarding                                              |
| `create-prd`     | `sdp.prd`       | Gate 1                                                         |
| `refine-backlog` | `sdp.analyst`   | Gate 2                                                         |
| `design-system`  | `sdp.architect` | Gate 3                                                         |
| `plan-task`      | `sdp.planner`   | Gate 4                                                         |
| `implement`      | `sdp.developer` | Gate 5                                                         |
| `run-review`     | `sdp.reviewer`  | Gate 6                                                         |
| `audit-security` | `sdp.security`  | Gate 6 (skipped if the epic's policy is `epic-level`/`waived`) |
| `qa-validate`    | `sdp.qa`        | Gate 6                                                         |

Prompts are located in `.github/prompts/` after installation and are accessible from the Copilot Chat prompt picker.

### Skills

Skills are focused, reusable technical guidance files that agents reference when performing specific programming tasks. They encode implementation patterns, conventions, and quality criteria for common web development operations.

Skills are located in `.github/skills/` and follow the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io) — each skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file with metadata and instructions.

| Skill                    | Folder                        | Purpose                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Write Tests              | `skills/write-tests/`         | Unit and integration tests using the AAA pattern; TDD guidance                     |
| Create REST API Endpoint | `skills/create-api-endpoint/` | Route design, input validation, authentication, error responses, and documentation |
| Create UI Component      | `skills/create-ui-component/` | Component structure, accessibility, state management, and testing                  |

### Templates

The `.github/templates/` folder contains starter files for extending SDP, and canonical templates for every gate artifact (each requires a `status: draft | approved | rejected` header):

| File                 | Purpose                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `template.prompt.md` | Starter template for authoring a custom prompt                                                             |
| `template.skill.md`  | Starter template for authoring a custom skill                                                              |

## Customization

SDP is designed to coexist with existing tooling and custom workflows. SDP-managed files are isolated and will not conflict with your own additions.

| What to customize                    | How                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project-specific AI coding standards | Extend `.github/instructions/coding-standards.instructions.md`                                     |
| Custom agents                        | Add `.agent.md` files to `.github/agents/` — SDP updates will not touch them                       |
| Custom prompts                       | Add prompt files to `.github/prompts/`                                                             |
| Custom skills                        | Add `<skill-name>/SKILL.md` folders to `.github/skills/` using the provided template               |
| Scoped agent context                 | Add `AGENTS.md` files at repository root and module boundaries                                     |
| Technology context                   | Edit `.github/TECH.md` — this file is never overwritten by SDP updates unless explicitly requested |

```

### Installed Layout (client repository)

After running the installer, the following structure is created under `.github/` in the target repository:

```md
.github/
├── TECH.md <- Project technology context (fill this in)
├── sdp-version <- Installed SDP version marker
├── agents/ <- SDP agent definitions
├── instructions/ <- SDLC process instructions (includes coding-standards.instructions.md)
├── prompts/ <- Gate trigger prompts
├── skills/
│ ├── <skill-name>/
│ │ └── SKILL.md
│ └── ...
└── templates/
├── ACTIVE.md
├── AGENTS.md
├── TECH.md
├── PRD.md
├── BACKLOG.md
├── EPIC.md
├── DESIGN.md
├── PLAN.md
├── HISTORY.md
├── template.agent.md
├── template.prompt.md
└── template.skill.md
```

### Recommended `AGENTS.md` Placement

```md
<repository root>/
├── AGENTS.md <- Global context boundaries and repository rules
├── src/
│ ├── Billing/
│ │ ├── AGENTS.md <- Service-local context (e.g., next to .csproj)
│ │ └── Billing.csproj
│ └── Frontend/
│ ├── AGENTS.md <- App/package-local context
│ └── package.json
```

### Runtime Artifacts (created by agents in the client repository)

```md
spec/
├── ACTIVE.md <- Currently active feature
└── <feature-slug>/
├── PRD.md
├── BACKLOG.md
├── EPIC-\*.md
├── DESIGN.md
├── PLAN.md
└── HISTORY.md
```

## Package Distribution

SDP is distributed as an [Agent Package Manager (APM)](https://agentpackagemanager.io) compatible package. The `apm.yml` manifest defines all framework components:

- **Components:** 8 agents, 9 prompts, 5 skills, global instructions, and templates
- **Install path:** `.github/` in the target repository
- **Source directory:** `.apm/` in this repository
- **Installers:** bash (`install.sh`) and PowerShell (`install.ps1`)
- **Marketplace outputs:** `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`

APM producer release flow (recommended):

```bash
# 1) Validate marketplace entries resolve
apm marketplace check

# 2) Build marketplace artifacts
apm pack --marketplace=claude,codex

# 3) Commit generated marketplace files and tag a release
git add .claude-plugin/marketplace.json .agents/plugins/marketplace.json apm.yml
git commit -m "release: update marketplace index"
git tag spec-development-protocol-v0.4.0
git push --tags
```

For npm ecosystem compatibility:

```bash
npm install -g @wojcikmm/spec-development-protocol
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Source changes belong in `.apm/`** — never edit files under `.github/` as template source. The `.github/` folder in this repository is for maintainer automation only.
2. **Keep templates generic** — all files in `.apm/` must be reusable across different project types and tech stacks.
3. **Update documentation** — if you change behavior in `install.sh` or `install.ps1`, update the corresponding sections in this `README.md`.
4. **Validate the installer** — run `bash -n install.sh` to check for syntax errors before submitting a pull request.
5. **Preserve gate discipline** — changes to agents or prompts must maintain the 6-gate sequential process and human-approval model.

For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss the proposed direction before submitting a pull request.
