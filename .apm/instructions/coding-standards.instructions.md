description: This file defines the global coding standards for all code produced by agents in the Spec Development Protocol (SDP). These standards apply across all languages, frameworks, and project types. They are designed to ensure high code quality, maintainability, security, and consistency with the project's technical guidelines as defined in `TECH.md`.

# Global Coding Standards

These apply to all code produced regardless of language, framework, or project type. Adjust specifics to the stack defined in `TECH.md`.

For SDLC orchestration, gate ordering, agent routing, `AGENTS.md` context strategy, plan scope budgets, and hardening policy, see `@/.github/instructions/sdlc-process.instructions.md` — that file is the single source of truth for process. Do not duplicate process rules here; this file governs code quality only.

### Code Quality
- **Clean Code first:** small, focused functions with a single clear responsibility.
- **Naming is communication:** use intent-revealing names for variables, functions, classes, and files. Avoid abbreviations unless they are universally understood in the domain.
- **YAGNI:** do not add functionality until it is needed. Avoid speculative abstractions.
- **DRY with judgment:** eliminate duplication, but do not abstract prematurely. Three occurrences before extracting a shared concept is a reasonable heuristic.
- **Avoid deep nesting:** prefer early returns, guard clauses, and flat logic over nested conditionals.
- **Functions and methods:** prefer pure functions where possible. Side effects should be explicit and isolated at system boundaries.

### Architecture & Design
- **Separation of concerns:** keep infrastructure, application logic, and domain rules in separate layers.
- **Dependency direction:** dependencies should point inward toward domain/core logic, never outward.
- **Ports and adapters (Hexagonal):** use interfaces/contracts at external boundaries (HTTP, DB, messaging, file system). This keeps the core testable and portable.
- **Right-size the design:** a simple CRUD endpoint does not need a domain model. A financial transaction processor does. Match complexity to the problem.
- **Prefer composition over inheritance.**

### Error Handling
- **Fail fast:** validate at system entry points (API boundaries, CLI inputs, event consumers). Do not let invalid data propagate deep into business logic.
- **Errors are data:** represent failures explicitly (result types, structured errors) rather than using exceptions for control flow where avoidable.
- **Surface actionable messages:** error messages should help the operator or developer understand what failed and why. Never expose stack traces or internal details to end users.
- **Distinguish error categories:** transient (retry-able) vs. permanent (fail fast) vs. programmer errors (crash loudly in dev, alert in prod).

### Testing
- **Test pyramid:** unit tests are the foundation, integration tests verify boundaries, end-to-end tests cover critical user paths only.
- **Test behavior, not implementation:** tests should validate what the code does, not how it does it internally. Avoid testing private methods directly.
- **One assertion focus per test:** each test should answer one question. Use descriptive test names that describe the scenario and expected outcome.
- **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA):** structure tests consistently with clear setup, execution, and verification sections.
- **Tests must pass before merging.** No skipped or commented-out tests without a documented reason.
- **Coverage is a proxy, not a goal:** aim for meaningful coverage of business-critical and error paths, not 100% line coverage of trivial code.

### Security (Always On)
Apply these regardless of whether a formal security review has been done:
- **Input validation at boundaries:** validate and sanitize all external input — HTTP requests, file uploads, event payloads, CLI arguments.
- **Output encoding:** encode output appropriate to context (HTML, SQL, shell) to prevent injection attacks.
- **Least privilege:** components, services, and users should have only the permissions they need to do their job.
- **No secrets in code or version control:** use environment variables, secret managers (e.g. Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault), or CI/CD secret stores.
- **Secure defaults:** default to deny-all access, require HTTPS/TLS, set secure cookie flags, apply CORS policies explicitly.
- **Dependency hygiene:** flag and address known vulnerable dependencies. Do not add new dependencies without justification.
- **OWASP Top 10 awareness:** treat injection, broken auth, IDOR, security misconfiguration, and sensitive data exposure as active threats in every feature.

### Observability
- **Structured logging:** emit logs as structured data (JSON preferred) with consistent fields: timestamp, level, correlation/trace ID, service name, message, relevant context.
- **Log levels with intent:** DEBUG for development detail, INFO for significant state transitions, WARN for recoverable anomalies, ERROR for failures requiring attention.
- **Never log sensitive data:** no passwords, tokens, PII, or financial details in logs.
- **Health and readiness:** expose health check endpoints on all services. Distinguish liveness (is the process alive) from readiness (is it ready to serve traffic).
- **Metrics at boundaries:** measure and expose latency, error rates, and throughput at external-facing boundaries and critical internal operations.

### Version Control & Commits
- **Atomic commits:** each commit represents one logical change. A commit should be explainable in a single sentence.
- **Commit messages:** use the imperative mood in the subject line (`Add`, `Fix`, `Remove`, not `Added`, `Fixed`). Reference issue/story IDs where applicable.
- **Branch per story/task:** never commit feature work directly to the main/trunk branch.
- **No commented-out code in commits:** delete unused code. Version control preserves history.

### Documentation
- **Code should read as documentation:** prioritize self-documenting code over comments. Comments explain *why*, not *what*.
- **Update docs with code:** if a change affects an API contract, architectural decision, or user-facing behavior, update the corresponding documentation in the same commit/PR.
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):** for significant technical decisions, record the context, options considered, and rationale in a short ADR file.

### Greenfield vs. Legacy
- **Greenfield:** establish the full structure from `TECH.md` up front. Set linting, testing, and CI standards before writing feature code.
- **Legacy:** prefer the strangler fig pattern — incrementally improve at touch points rather than rewriting working code. Respect existing conventions until a deliberate decision to change them is made and documented.
